    "**Q8. If a data point has only 2 neighbors of the same class within a radius of 0.5, what is its anomaly score using KNN with K=10?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The anomaly score using K-nearest neighbors (KNN) with K=10 depends on the number of anomalies within the neighborhood of the data point. In this case, if a data point has only 2 neighbors of the same class within a radius of 0.5 and K=10, it implies that there are no anomalous neighbors within the specified radius. Therefore, the anomaly score for this data point using KNN with K=10 would be relatively low, indicating that it is similar to its neighbors.\n",

    "**Q9. Using the Isolation Forest algorithm with 100 trees and a dataset of 3000 data points, what is the anomaly score for a data point that has an average path length of 5.0 compared to the average path length of the trees?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Isolation Forest algorithm, the anomaly score for a data point is computed based on its average path length in multiple isolation trees. A shorter average path length indicates that the data point is easier to isolate and is more likely to be an anomaly. Conversely, a longer average path length suggests that the data point is similar to normal instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a data point has an average path length of 5.0 compared to the average path length of the trees, it means that on average, it took 5 splits in the isolation trees to isolate this data point. Lower average path lengths typically indicate higher anomaly scores, so a data point with an average path length of 5.0 is considered less of an anomaly compared to those with shorter path lengths. The exact interpretation may vary depending on the specific dataset and context.\n"
