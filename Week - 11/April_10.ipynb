    "**Q1. A company conducted a survey of its employees and found that 70% of the employees use the company's health insurance plan, while 40% of the employees who use the plan are smokers. What is the probability that an employee is a smoker given that he/she uses the health insurance plan?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the probability that an employee is a smoker given that they use the health insurance plan, you can use conditional probability. In this case, you want to calculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(Smoker | Uses Health Insurance Plan) = ? $$\n",

    "- \\( A \\) represents being a smoker.\n",
    "- \\( B \\) represents using the health insurance plan.\n",

    "**Q2. What is the difference between Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bernoulli Naive Bayes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Designed for binary data, where features are either 0 (absence) or 1 (presence), often used in document classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multinomial Naive Bayes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suitable for discrete count or frequency data, commonly used in text classification with features like word counts or term frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. How does Bernoulli Naive Bayes handle missing values?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli Naive Bayes can handle missing values in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It can consider missing values as a separate category alongside 0 and 1, treating them as a third possible value for a feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Alternatively, you can impute missing values using methods like mean, median, or mode imputation to convert them into 0s or 1s, making the data suitable for Bernoulli Naive Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Can Gaussian Naive Bayes be used for multi-class classification?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Naive Bayes can be used for multi-class classification tasks. It is appropriate when features are continuous and follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution. The algorithm estimates Gaussian distribution parameters (mean and variance) for each class's features and uses Bayes' theorem to classify new data into one of the multiple classes.\n",

    "### Data Preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download the \"Spambase Data Set\"** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase). This dataset contains email messages, and the goal is to predict whether a message is spam or not based on several input features.\n",

    "### Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implement Naive Bayes Classifiers:**\n",
    "    - Implement Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers using the scikit-learn library in Python.\n",
    "    - Use 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of each classifier on the dataset.\n",

    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the three Naive Bayes variants, **Bernoulli Naive Bayes** achieved the highest accuracy, precision, and F1 score, performing well in distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multinomial Naive Bayes**, while having a lower accuracy than Bernoulli Naive Bayes, still demonstrated reasonable performance in classifying emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gaussian Naive Bayes** showed a high recall rate, indicating that it is good at identifying spam emails (fewer false negatives). However, it had a lower precision compared to the other two, leading to a lower F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bernoulli Naive Bayes is suitable when the features are binary or binary-like (e.g., presence or absence of words in text classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multinomial Naive Bayes is typically used for discrete data, often in text classification where features represent word counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes that features follow a Gaussian distribution, which may not hold for all types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Naive Bayes classifiers assume independence between features, which may not always hold in real-world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The choice of Naive Bayes variant should be based on the nature of the data and problem requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These results represent the performance with default hyperparameters; fine-tuning and feature engineering may further improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this evaluation, **Bernoulli Naive Bayes** performed the best overall in classifying spam and non-spam emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multinomial Naive Bayes** also showed reasonable performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gaussian Naive Bayes** had high recall but lower precision, which might not be ideal for all applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of the most suitable Naive Bayes variant depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the desired trade-offs between precision, recall, and overall accuracy.\n"
