    "\n",
    "    Ridge Regression is a variant of linear regression used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable\n",
    "    and one or more independent variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "    It differs from ordinary least squares (OLS) regression in the way it adds a regularization term to the loss function.\n",
    "    In Ridge Regression, a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients (L2 regularization) \n",
    "    is added to the sum of squared errors. This penalty helps prevent overfitting by constraining the coefficients from \n",
    "    becoming too large. \n",
    "    In contrast, OLS regression does not include such a penalty term."
