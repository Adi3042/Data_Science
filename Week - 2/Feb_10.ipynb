    "### **Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.** ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The `open(filename, mode)` function is used to open files in Python. There are several modes available to open a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **r**: Open a file for reading.\n",
    "- **w**: Open a file for writing. Creates a new file if it does not exist or truncates the file if it exists.\n",
    "- **x**: Open a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, the operation fails.\n",
    "- **a**: Open a file for appending at the end of the file without truncating it. Creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",
    "- **t**: Open in text mode.\n",
    "- **b**: Open in binary mode.\n",
    "- **+**: Open a file for updating (reading and writing).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?** ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The `close()` function is used to close an open file. It is essential to close a file because, in some cases, due to buffering, changes made to a file may not show until you close the file. Failing to close a file properly can result in data loss or file corruption.\n",
