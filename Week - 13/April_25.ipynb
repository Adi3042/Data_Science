    "\n",
    "A square matrix A is diagonalizable using the eigen-decomposition approach if and only if it has a complete set of eigenvectors. A complete set of eigenvectors is a set of n eigenvectors that are linearly independent, where n is the dimension of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix A is diagonalizable if and only if there exists a non-singular matrix P such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P^{-1}AP = D\n",

    "Suppose A has a complete set of eigenvectors. Then, we can construct a matrix P whose columns are the eigenvectors of A. P will be a non-singular matrix since the eigenvectors of A are linearly independent. Multiplying both sides of the equation $$ P^{-1}AP = D $$ by P, we get:\n",

    "A = P^{-1}PDP^{-1} = D\n",
    "$$\n",

    "A = PDP^{-1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying both sides of the equation by P, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "AP = PD\n",

    "The columns of AP are the eigenvectors of A, since they are the vectors that are multiplied by the eigenvalues to produce themselves.\n",

    "Since the columns of AP are linearly independent, and A is a square matrix, the columns of AP must be a complete set of eigenvectors of A.\n",

    "**Q4. What is the significance of the spectral theorem in the context of the Eigen-Decomposition approach? How is it related to the diagonalizability of a matrix? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectral theorem is significant in the context of the eigen-decomposition approach because it guarantees that a matrix A is diagonalizable if and only if it has n linearly independent eigenvectors, where n is the dimension of the matrix. This theorem provides the conditions for the existence of an eigen-decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following Hermitian matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "A = [[1, 2], [2, 1]]\n",
    "\n",
    "The eigen-decomposition of A is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "λ1 = 3, λ2 = -1\n",
    "v1 = [1, 1], v2 = [1, -1]\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the eigenvalues of A are 3 and -1, and the corresponding eigenvectors are [1, 1] and [1, -1], respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To diagonalize A, we can use the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D = V^TAV\n",

    "\n",
    "Av = λv\n",
    "\n",
    "where λ is the eigenvalue of A.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that when an eigenvector is multiplied by the matrix, it is only scaled by the eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvectors are orthogonal to each other, meaning that the dot product of any two eigenvectors is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Q7. Can you explain the geometric interpretation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometric interpretation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues is that eigenvectors represent the directions in which a matrix scales space, and eigenvalues represent the amount of scaling in those directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "A = [[2, 0], [0, 1]]\n",
    "\n",
    "The eigenvalues of A are 2 and 1, and the corresponding eigenvectors are [1, 0] and [0, 1], respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometric interpretation of this is that the matrix A scales space by a factor of 2 in the direction of the x-axis and by a factor of 1 in the direction of the y-axis.\n",

    "---\n",
    "**Q8. What are some real-world applications of eigen decomposition?**\n",

    "\n",
    "A matrix can have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues if it is not diagonalizable.\n",

    "A matrix is diagonalizable if and only if it has a complete set of eigenvectors. A complete set of eigenvectors is a set of n eigenvectors that are linearly independent, where n is the dimension of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a matrix does not have a complete set of eigenvectors, then it cannot be diagonalized and it will have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues.\n",
